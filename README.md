# Skyrim Search SE

This is new version of [Skyrim Search Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50435/) for Skyrim Special Edition.

This plugin adds some console commands that allows you to search for NPCs, cells, and quests by FormID/EditorID/Name.
Moreover, you can find refIds of NPCs, codes for `coc` command, and quest stage number for `completequest` command.
The most important point of using this plugin over other tools is that it works in game, and fully-synchronized with your environment.
(it can search custom followers too!)
